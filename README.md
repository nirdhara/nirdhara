## Built with  

- Back End API: We use [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a Node.js framework, to build our server-side applications. These apps handle incoming requests and respond in JSON format, following RESTful principles.
- Front End: Our front-end applications are built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It interacts with the Nest API to provide a seamless user experience.

We also use various JavaScript libraries, which can be found in our package.json files.
